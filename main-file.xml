			<p>Just off the coast of Japan sits a small island, a little under half the size of
				Rhode Island. This island is host to subtropical climates, excessive humidity, and
				an annual rainfall of approximately 83 inches. Here, with its hilly plateaus, peaks
				that reach upward to 1,650 feet, ravines trekking mazes across the land, and the
				plains with rolling hills, stands Okinawa. </p>
			<p>Though Okinawa is only 300 miles from Japan, their economic and cultural ties were
				more connected to China until the seventeenth century. Between 1871 and 1879 Japan’s
				hold on Okinawa loosened, but in 1879 Okinawa became a prefecture of Japan. </p>
			<p>Okinawans, while they resemble Japanese people, are different culturally and have
				different racial origins. The Okinawans have a mixed racial origin with very little
				European blood; only the Itoman area shows noticeable mixture with Portuguese blood.
				Besides blood lines Okinawans are also seen as mild-mannered, courteous, and
				subservient and are said to have no value in exactness, cleanliness, and
				orderliness. However, looking through history itself, this exact description could
				be applied to any group of conquered people by the conquerors. On this note, it is
				also important to point out that the native language of Okinawa is Luchuan or
				Ryukyuan, however, in large cities like Naha and Shuri, Japanese was widely spoken.
				Following the war in 1945, there is documented evidence of Japanese teachers in
				Okinawan schools teaching in Japanese. This transition helped further the transition
				of Okinawa into Japanese culture. </p>
			<p>An interesting fact to add here is that while most Okinawans consider themselves
				Japanese, they consider themselves Okinawan first. But during the war it was clear
				Japan likely did not feel the same way. While Japan made claims to protect the
				Okinawan people, they used Okinawa caves to take shelter in while leaving the natives
				above as a barrier between Japanese forces and American explosives. 
				The article <hi rend="italic">"The Rape of Okinawa"</hi> from Duke University Press mentions that many if not most
				American soldiers were unaware of the civilan death toll as it was rarely mentioned
				to them. One commander of the Sixth Marine Division left after the three month long
				campaign on the tiny island with the belief only 20,000 civilians had died in the
				fighting. Due to destruction of documents from battles and the cruel treatment by
				Japanese forces, it was not immediately known that approximately 150,000 native Okinawans lost their lives. </p>
			<p>During the bombing of the southern part of Okinawa, Japanese forces ordered Okinawan
				natives to the northern part of the island which was lined with “dummie
				fortification” giving the false sense of resistance for U.S. Marine forces and the
				surprise of more than double the number of expected civilians. The U.S. Army forces
				faced more resistance in the south and found fewer than expected civilians. During
				this invasion, U.S. military was instructed to avoid damaging specific native towns,
				unfortunately they leveled many of them instead. The fighting forces continued to
				push for usage of the island to be military based, leaving the natives with very
				little room to live. This became such a problem that a Navy captain was quoted saying
				“What do they expect us to do hang them from sky-hooks?” (Ford, Pg 178)</p>
			<p>When the ashes finally settled from the battle, Okinawans were no longer at the mercy
				of Japan but now of the American forces. Six weeks prior to Tokyo surrendering,
				American forces took control of Okinawa with an occupation that would last until
				1972. While Okinawa was left to the combat forces’ control; mainland Japan was left
				to American Civilians to plan the purpose of post war occupation and only lasted
				till 1952. Tokyo even volunteered to “donate” the island of Okinawa to the United
				States. During the war Japan used racial unity to try to convert Okinawans into
				fighters and when this failed, used them as fodder. Once the war was over they
				abandoned Okinawans with the mindset of a conqueror giving up their “inferior and
				dispensable” people to save their higher valued mainland. While Japan gradually returned to
				its daily life and benefited from job and baby booms, Okinawa was left to fend
				for itself with its new foreign conquerors.</p>
			<p>Among the conquerors were social scientists who came with the purpose of
				understanding how to interact and handle conquered people. They were in charge of
				calculating how to relocate and handle the natives. It became very clear to the
				social scientist that Okinawans were self-reliant, resilient, sophisticated, and
				ready to return to normal life when given the opportunity. After several months of U.S.
				occupation it was decided to relocate Okinawans throughout the island and reunite
				them with their respective families and communities. When military officials asked Okinawan leaders’
				opinion on how to best approach this they were surprised to learn the Okinawans had
				already compiled a census of where people were and where they were from, along with
				a plan to transport people from town to town without wasting any room in the
				trucks.</p>
			<p>In articles like <hi rend="italic">"Occupation Experiences on Okinawa"</hi> it seems while social scientist
				inhabited Okinawa, the Okinawans experienced some relief but with the departure of
				the scientist in October 1945, natives found themselves left with a military force
				less interested in their behavior and ways as a society and more with their own
				military interest in mind. As acknowledged before the military leveled many towns
				and took land for their bases. Often times they took prime land that would be
				essential in tourism and economic value for Okinawans. Many Okinawans oppose the
				presence of the bases concerned that the military makes their island a prime target
				for attacks by other militaries, that the bases impeded their economic growth, and
				due to the Status of Forces Agreement make it difficult to prosecute perpetrators in
				the military and their dependents for crimes they commit.</p>
