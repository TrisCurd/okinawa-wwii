      <p>Just off the coast of Japan sits a small island, a little under half the size of
         				Rhode Island. This island is host to subtropical climates, excessive humidity,
         and
         				an annual rainfall of approximately 83 inches. Here, with its hilly plateaus,
         peaks
         				that reach upward to 1,650 feet, ravines trekking mazes across the land, and the
         				plains with rolling hills, stands Okinawa. </p>
      			
      <p>Though Okinawa is only 300 miles from Japan, their economic and cultural ties were
         				more connected to China until the seventeenth century. Between 1871 and 1879 Japan’s
         				hold on Okinawa loosened, but in 1879 Okinawa became a prefecture of Japan. </p>
      			
      <p>Okinawans, while they resemble Japanese people, are different culturally and have
         				different racial origins. The Okinawans have a mixed racial origin with very little
         				European blood; only the Itoman area shows noticeable mixture with Portuguese
         blood.
         				Besides blood lines Okinawans are also seen as mild-mannered, courteous, and
         				subservient and are said to have no value in exactness, cleanliness, and
         				orderliness. However, looking through history itself, this exact description could
         				be applied to any group of conquered people by the conquerors. On this note, it
         is
         				also important to point out that the native language of Okinawa is Luchuan or
         				Ryukyuan, however, in large cities like Naha and Shuri, Japanese was widely spoken.
         				Following the war in 1945, there is documented evidence of Japanese teachers in
         				Okinawan schools teaching in Japanese. This transition helped further the transition
         				of Okinawa into Japanese culture. </p>
      			
      <p>An interesting fact to add here is that while most Okinawans consider themselves
         				Japanese they do consider themselves Okinawan first. But during the war it was
         clear
         				Japan likely did not feel the same way. While Japan made claims to protect the
         				Okinawan people they used Okinawa caves to shelter in while leaving the natives
         				above as a barrier between Japan forces and American explosives. It was mentioned
         in
         				The Rape of Okinawa article from Duke University Press, that many if not most
         				American soldiers were unaware of the civilan death toll as it was rarely mentioned
         				to them. One commander of the Sixth Marine Division left after the three month
         long
         				campaign on the tiny island with the belief only 20,000 civilians had died in
         the
         				fighting. Due to destruction of documents from battles and the cruel treatment
         by
         				Japanese forces it was not immediately known that native Okinawans lost 150,000
         of
         				their people. </p>
      			
      <p>During the bombing of the southern part of Okinawa Japan forces ordered Okinawan
         				natives to the northern part of the island which was lined with “dummie
         				fortification” giving the false sense of resistance for U.S. Marine forces and
         the
         				surprise of more than double the number of expected civilians. The U.S. Army forces
         				faced more resistance in the south and found fewer than expected civilians. During
         				this invasion, U.S. military was instructed to avoid damaging specific native
         towns,
         				unfortunately they leveled many of them instead. The fighting forces continued
         to
         				push for usage of the island to be military based, leaving the natives with very
         				little room to live. This became such a problem a Navy captain was quoted saying
         				“What do they expect us to do hang them from sky-hooks?” (Ford, Pg 178)</p>
      			
      <p>When the ashes finally settled from the battle, Okinawans were no longer at the mercy
         				of Japan but now of the American forces. Six weeks prior to Tokyo surrendering,
         				American forces took control of Okinawa with an occupation that would last until
         				1972. While Okinawa was left to the combat forces’ control; mainland Japan was
         left
         				to American Civilians to plan the purpose of post war occupation and only lasted
         				till 1952. Tokyo even volunteered to “donate” the island of Okinawa to the United
         				States. During the war Japan used racial unity to try to convert Okinawans into
         				fighters and when this failed used them as fodder, and once the war was over they
         				abandoned Okinawans with the mindset of a conqueror giving up their “inferior
         and
         				dispensable” people to save their higher valued mainland. While Japan returned
         to
         				their daily lives and benefited from job and baby booms, Okinawa was left to fend
         				for itself with its new foreign conquerors.</p>
      			
      <p>Among those conquerors were social scientists who came with the purpose of
         				understanding how to interact and handle conquered people. They were in charge
         of
         				calculating how to relocate and handle the natives. It became very clear to the
         				social scientist that Okinawans were self-reliant, resilient, sophisticated, and
         				ready to return to normal when given the opportunity. After several months of
         U.S.
         				occupation it was decided to relocate Okinawans throughout the island and reunite
         				them with family and communities. When military officials asked Okinawan leaders’
         				opinion on how to best approach this they were surprised to learn the Okinawans
         had
         				already compiled a census of where people were and where they were from, along
         with
         				a plan to transport people from town to town without wasting any room in the
         				trucks.</p>
      			
      <p>In articles like Occupation Experiences on Okinawa it seems while social scientist
         				inhabited Okinawa, the Okinawans experienced some relief but with the departure
         of
         				the scientist in October 1945, natives found themselves left with a military force
         				less interested in their behavior and ways as a society and more with their own
         				military interest in mind. As acknowledged before the military leveled many towns
         				and took land for their bases. Often times they took prime land that would be
         				essential in tourism and economic value for Okinawans. Many Okinawans oppose the
         				presence of the bases concerned that the military makes their island a prime target
         				for attacks by other militaries, that the bases impeded their economic growth,
         and
         				due to the Status of Forces Agreement make it difficult to prosecute perpetrators
         in
         				the military and their dependents for crimes they commit.</p>
