      		(Approx) 15 May 45. Okinawa. One of the many Japanese dugouts that
      			honeycombed the ridges of Okinawa. In addition to use as storage space, they
      			were used as resting places for personnel. (Signal Corps Photo). Fusco, 3231
      			Sig. Photo Det.
      		The “typhoon of bombs and shells,” as the natives called the American
      			explosives, slew and maimed more civilians than the Japanese defenders in the
      			“underground battleships” they had made of their caves.” (Feifer, p.33) 
      	
      	
      		
      		(Aprox) 7 May 1945. Okinawa. The city of Naha, largest on the island of
      			Okinawa (pop 65,000) lies in ruins, the result of heavy and continuous bombings
      			as the U.S. tenth army advances southward toward the city against stiff Jap
      			resistance. A Jap ship rests on the bottom of the shallow water at lower left,
      			while two large buildings, believed to be schools can be seen still standing in
      			upper center and right. (Signal Corps Photo). Rosenthal, 3235 Sig. Photo
